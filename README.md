# Web_Scrape
This project is used to scrape the data from AirDNA's website for the city of Surrey, BC

I wanted to analyze the Surrey, BC Airbnb market. AirDNA provides you with data however it's in view only format. Their website provides you with their own dashboards and reports however it does not allow you to aggregate and do any detailed analysis. So using the requests library and beautifulsoup I made calls to their API to extract the data into CSV for my own analysis.
