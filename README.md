# Web_Scrape
This project is used to scrape the data from AirDNA's website for the city of Surrey, BC

I wanted to analyze the Surrey, BC Airbnb market. AirDNA provides you with data however it's in view only format hidden on their website. So using the requests library and beautifulsoup I made calls to their API to extract the data into CSV for further analysis.
